üó∫Ô∏è Map & Marker System (Leaflet)

Integrated Leaflet in React and displayed cafes as markers.

Implemented custom map center state and dynamic updates.

MapFlyTo feature:

Map animates and zooms into a cafe when a card is clicked.

Selected marker is highlighted with a custom icon.

Handled marker customization:

Replaced default markers with custom icons for cafes and user location.

Fixed asset import path issues for icons.

Map height and layout were adjusted to prevent full-page scroll while keeping the cafe list scrollable separately.

üìç Geolocation & User Position

Implemented getUserLocation() utility using navigator.geolocation API:

Graceful fallback to default location if access is denied.

Clean separation of logic into a reusable function.

Displayed user‚Äôs current location as a map marker.

Used the user‚Äôs location as a reference point for distance calculations.

üß† Distance & Proximity Logic

Learned and implemented Haversine formula for calculating distances between latitude/longitude points.

Distance used to:

Filter cafes within a dynamic radius.

Sort and display nearest cafes first.

Display distance directly in cafe cards.

Added dynamic radius and max cafe filtering using sliders, updating map and list in real-time.

üîé Search & Geocoding

Implemented location search with backend /api/geocode endpoint using Nominatim (OpenStreetMap).

Queried backend /api/cafes endpoint to find cafes near the searched location.

Combined geocoding results and user location to compute nearest cafes.

Problems faced:

Initial ‚Äúq is not defined‚Äù error solved by passing the correct query parameter to the Nominatim service.

Debugged coordinate fetching and axios requests for proper integration with React frontend.

üß∞ Code Organization & Refactoring

Refactored core logic out of App.jsx into separate utilities:

getUserLocation.js ‚Äì geolocation logic.

getDistance.js ‚Äì Haversine formula utility.

fetchCafes.js ‚Äì combined geocoding, cafe fetching, filtering by distance, and max results.

Backend organized into controllers, routes, and services for clarity:

geocodeController.js, nominatimService.js, cafesController.js, overpassService.js

Improved readability, maintainability, and reusability.

üßë‚Äçüíª UI & UX Enhancements

Refined layout:

Divided page into left and right columns: left for search, controls, and cafe list; right for map.

Adjusted map height to prevent full-page scroll.

Implemented Controls Card:

Combined radius and max cafes sliders in one card.

Sliders visually improved and responsive with modern rounded style.

Updated to dark theme:

Changed background colors, header, search bar, controls, and cafe cards for better contrast.

Cafe cards now display distance in km prominently.

‚ö° Problems & Solutions

| Problem                                      | Solution / Debugging                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `q is not defined` in geocoding              | Fixed by passing correct parameter to `fetchCoordinates` service.                       |
| Map height causing full-page scroll          | Split layout with left column scrollable (`CafeList`) and map fixed height.             |
| Search sliders not updating map in real-time | Used React `useEffect` on slider state and passed dynamic parameters to fetch function. |
| Marker icon import failing                   | Corrected asset path and ensured Leaflet uses proper image URLs.                        |
| Handling empty search input                  | Added validation in `handleSearch` to alert user.                                       |


üåê Backend

Built Express server with two endpoints:

/api/geocode ‚Äì converts text location to coordinates.

/api/cafes ‚Äì fetches cafes near coordinates using Overpass API.

Used Axios for external API calls.
